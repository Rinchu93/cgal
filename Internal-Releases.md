Every day, at 9pm, Paris local time, which is either CET (winter) or
CEST (summer), a new internal release is created. The branch that is
tested by the internal release is not always the same.
The results of the test suites are posted on the
[test suite results](http://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/Members/testsuite/) page.

**Note that most of the test results are published the following day.**

## Summary
