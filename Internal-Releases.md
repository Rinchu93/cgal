Every day, at 9pm, Paris local time, which is either CET (winter) or
CEST (summer), a new internal release is created. The branch that is
tested by the internal release is not always the same.

**Note that most of the test results are published the following day.**

## Summary


Internal releases are published every night. The day of week in the
following table indicates the day of the creation of the internal
release, and thus the beginning of CGAL testsuite process. Usually you
