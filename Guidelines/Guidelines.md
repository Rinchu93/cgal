## Guidelines

These guides are meant to be a resource for developers who
wish to contribute to the CGAL library either by designing new packages
or maintaining or enhancing existing ones. They are organized roughly in
the order in which a developer will need the information in order to
produce a package for the library. New developers should also read 
[Information for new developers](Information-for-New-Developers)
and the [public developer manual](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/dev_manual.html).
