Whether you produce library code, demos, documentation or something
else, and when you have been invited as a [CGAL developer](https://www.cgal.org/project_rules.html#developers), if you want your work to become part of CGAL, you'll have to submit it in
the form of a page in the *internal CGAL wiki* on [Features](https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/Members/wiki/Features) or on
[Small Features](https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/Members/wiki/Features/Small_Features) (please
follow the template given there), and announce it by email to the
[editorial board mailing list](Mailing-Lists).

Please carefully read the [submission and review](https://www.cgal.org/review_process_rules.html).
