# CGAL Projects Page for the Google Summer of Code 2018


The CGAL Project is applying as a mentoring organization of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) 2018.
On this page we present some project ideas as well the [information](#information-candidates-should-supply) applicants have to provide us.
GSoC applicants are welcome to propose other ideas and check if a mentor is interested in supervising it. For new project
proposals, contact us at [gsoc-cgal@inria.fr](mailto:gsoc-cgal@inria.fr).

## Projects
### Reworking Intersection Functions
**Mentor(s)**: Sebastien Loriot

**Project description:**
The goal of this project is to rewrite all the intersection predicates (`do_intersect_2/3`) to provide more information, but at the same time staying backward compatible. For example, say you want to know whether two segments intersect but also where lies the intersection, in the interior or at an endpoint of each segment. If the student is fast enough, an extension of the project is to rewrite intersection computation functions to take into account the result of the do-intersect predicate to speed up the computation.

**Required Skills:** C++, generic programming, basic geometry

**Contact:** sebastien.loriot@cgal.org


## Information Candidates Should Supply
The application process has several steps. Before contacting anybody verify that you are eligible, that is
that you are enrolled as student, don't get a tuition fee, etc. The next step is to contact the mentor
of the project you are interested in. You have to convince him that you are the right person to get the job
done. The next step is to work out more details and to contact the mentoring organization by providing
the following information by email to [gsoc-cgal@inria.fr](mailto:gsoc-cgal@inria.fr):


* Project:
  * Select a project in the list and provide your personal and detailed description. If you wish to work on another idea of your own, we are pretty open as long as this serves the goal of consolidating CGAL as a whole.
  * Provide a proposal of a technical solution with your envisioned methodology. The more detailed the better.
  * Explain how the solution will be available to the user, in which form. Do not forget the documentation, unitary tests and cross-platform aspects.
  * Provide a realistic schedule with objectives (one every two weeks for example) and deadlines. Focus on mid-term objectives as well as on the final evaluation.
  * Provide a formal commitment that you will be involved full time on the GSoC. This is absolutely mandatory.


* Personal data:
  * First name, last name, affiliation and geographical location.
  * A brief list of the main studies and programming courses attended, with ranking.
  * List of the most important software projects contributed and success.
  * Which are your best skills in terms of programming and scientific computing?
  * In general what is your taste in terms of programming? language, methodology, team work, etc.
  * Is there anything that prevents you from working full time on the project during the program period?
  * How do you see your involvement after the program ends? Do you see yourself pushing the project further, or do you see yourself contributing to other CGAL projects?
  * Are you more interested in the theory/scientific aspect of CGAL, or do you feel more like a hacker?
  * What are your long-term wishes in terms of job?
